# Niagara Most Wanted Using WebScraping and Tablea

In this project, I used web scraping techniques to pull the data from the Niagara Region Police Service [website](https://www.niagarapolice.ca/en/news-and-events/Niagara-s-Wanted.aspx) for the most wanted criminals.
Utilized the pandas library to explore and clean the data, then virtualized the results using Tableau. 

## Libraries & tools
1. Python 3.8.10
2. Tableau
3. BeautifulSoup
4. Requests
5. Pandas
6. Numpy

## Files:
1- NPRwanted.py: contains the codes for extracting the data from the NRPS website.
2- NPR.csv: contains the data extracted from NRPS (before cleaning)
3- dataCleaning.ipynb: exploring and cleaning the data.
4- Final_dfwithID.csv: contains the data after cleaning (used for Tableau virtualization)
